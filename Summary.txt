Technical Choices and Decisions

- Key Decisions

LocalStorage for Persistence:
    LocalStorage was chosen for simplicity in storing votes. It allows quick development without needing server-side integration.

Page-Specific Scoping:
    The getPageId function ensures polls with the same ID on different pages are scoped properly, preventing data conflicts.

Dynamic Rendering:
    The render function dynamically updates the DOM for seamless interaction and reset functionality.



- Improvements

Accessibility Enhancements:
 Add ARIA roles to improve usability for screen readers.

Validation for Options:
 Ensure options are non-empty and unique before initializing a poll.

Improved Storage Mechanism:
 Use an API or IndexedDB for large-scale applications requiring more robust storage.
